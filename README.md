# Make Change Project - Skill Distillery Week 1 Homework

### Description
This program is designed to replicate a cash register on giving the exact amount of change back from a total purchase.

An example would be if you were to input that the purchase due is $3.96 and you were to give the register a $20 dollar bill, then the program will run and display that you owe 1 ten dollar bill, 1 five dollar bill, 1 dollar bill and 4 pennies.

### Lesson Learned
The lessoned that really helped create the program has to be the method function that I used. Through the program there is a lot of repetition on using if and else if statements that were very helpful. But creating a new method and calling out the method made the code much simpler to read and follow through smoothly. To me it was kind of like working out the behind the scenes on making the program work especially using modules. Using modules helped input the math needed and being able to subtract that from the amount given and tendered was a great way to see how this code can be implemented to a real world scenario.
